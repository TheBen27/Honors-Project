Subject is swimming counterclockwise in a small circular pool.
The shark is prevented from swimming through the center via a large
pillar in the middle of the pool.

12:19:54 Students lift up the plastic and prod the shark with sticks, 
generally forcing it to turn around frequently. It's not moving any
faster, though. Occasionally, their prodducing moves the shark forward
instead of turning it around.

12:30:25 The students stop poking the shark and leave it in peace.
The students spend some time smoothing out the plastic ceiling on top of
the tank with their hands and some brushes. The shark doesn't seem to
care.

12:34:37 The students come back to smooth out the ceiling, which has
frayed a little on the edges.

12:44:30 The shark changes direction from counterclockwise to clockwise.
Before this, its revolutions got closer and closer to the central pillar.

12:44:41 It does a 360 revolution near the south end of the pool
(assuming the camera is facing north).

12:44:49 Does another 180. Do sharks prefer to swim counterclockwise?

For the rest of the video, the shark continues swimming, occasionally
making little 360 revolutions. Students may straighten out the
ceiling or come to observe. The shark also swims clockwise for very
brief periods.

The shark will sometimes switch direction for minutes at a time. Otherwise,
its movements are unremarkable.

15:41:55 A student reaches into the pool and seemingly pets the shark with
his hand.  This causes the shark to switch directions in order to avoid
approaching him.

15:44:14 Another student does the same thing in roughly the same
location. He or she appears to be actively turning the shark around
at every point.

15:45:08 Pushing behavior ends. However, the shark continues to turn away
from where it thinks the hands are.

15:48:10 The shark stops turning, but is now swimming clockwise. It
switches back and forth between counterclockwise and clockwise behavior,
suggesting that it's agitated, but its overall speed doesn't seem to change.

16:20:30 Switches to clockwise swimming and stays that way.

16:49:59 Starts turning rapidly and frequently

46 seconds
26 seconds
4 seconds
3 seconds
15 seconds
8 seconds
4 seconds
8 seconds

... And so on. It seems rather listless.

16:53:30 Resumes clockwise swimming pattern.

17:26:21 Starts the same rapid turning pattern as before.

17:31:?? Goes back to the old pattern.

17:48:43 The lights flicker. The shark starts swimming a fair bit faster.

17:59:10 A student comes in and fixes the pool's ceiling, causing the shark
to start turning rapidly.

18:02:00 The shark stops turning and is now going clockwise.

18:11:10 The same student fixes it again, causing another commotion.

18:15:20 Back to normal.
